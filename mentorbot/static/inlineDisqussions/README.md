inlineDisqussions
=================

inlineDisqussions is a jQuery plugin to allow inline comments on your site.  

Comments threads are created with the power of the awesome (and free) [Disqus](http://disqus.com/),  
they are created dynamically and attached to the specific sections (paragraph, usually, but not necessarily)
of your post.  

See demo and instructions at http://tsi.github.io/inlineDisqussions
